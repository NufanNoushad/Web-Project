# Web-Project

**What I Built & Learned 🔥
**
Set up a GitHub repo on AWS GitHub to securely store my Java web app source code - because your code deserves the best home.

Configured Git locally with my username and email - every commit needs a signature that says, “I own this!”

Initialised a local repo and connected it to my remote GitHub repo — seamless syncing, zero headaches.

Made my first commit & pushed it live to the master branch — boom, my code is now safely in the cloud.

**Why This Works 💪
**
This project isn’t just about pushing code - it’s about setting the stage for professional workflows, collaboration, and continuous integration. Knowing how to manage your code with Git & GitHub is a game changer in software development, and now I’m equipped.

**Java Web App Deployment with AWS
**
## What I Built & Learned 🔥

- Set up a GitHub repo on AWS GitHub to securely store my Java web app source code — because your code deserves the best home.

- Configured Git locally with my username and email - every commit needs a signature that says, “I own this!”

- Initialized a local repo and connected it to my remote GitHub repo - seamless syncing, zero headaches.

- Made my first commit & pushed it live to the master branch - boom, my code is now safely in the cloud.

## Why This Works 💪

This project isn’t just about pushing code - it’s about setting the stage for professional workflows, collaboration, and continuous integration. Knowing how to manage your code with Git & GitHub is a game changer in software development, and now I’m equipped.
